Objective:
To contribute to the success of a business by utilizing data analysis techniques, specifically focusing on time series analysis, to provide valuable insights and accurate sales forecasting.

Insights:
1) Despite overall high sales in the phones subcategory, the central region demonstrates comparatively lower sales performance.
2) State-wise analysis reveals that California leads in overall sales, while Texas dominates in the central region, New York in the east, Florida in the south, and California again in the west, which aligns with expectations.
3) When comparing profits between 2019 and 2020, except for April, profits are consistently higher in 2020. Interestingly, in April 2019, profit exceeded that of April 2020.
4) Month-on-month sales show a consistent increase in both 2019 and 2020. However, in 2020, sales nearly doubled compared to 2019.
5) There is a significant preference for standard shipping mode, indicating its popularity among customers.

Learning:
I have incorporated data analysis techniques, specializing in time series analysis, to deliver valuable insights, accurate sales forecasting, and interactive dashboard creation, driving business success.
